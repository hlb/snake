### Power-ups and Scoring
The game features four types of collectible food items:

- 🍕 **Normal Food**
  - Basic food items (🍕🍇🍪🍓)
  - Adds 1 point to score
  - Increases snake length

- 🌟 **Golden Food**
  - Rare, valuable food items (🌟⭐🌞)
  - Adds 2 points to score
  - Increases snake length

- ⚡ **Speed Food**
  - Speed boost power-up (⚡🚀💨)
  - Temporarily increases snake speed
  - Adds 1 point to score
  - Effect duration is temporary

- 🐌 **Slow Food**
  - Speed reduction power-up (🐌🦥🐢)
  - Temporarily decreases snake speed
  - Adds 1 point to score
  - Effect duration is temporary

### Game Mechanics
- Snake wraps around screen edges for continuous gameplay
- Colliding with obstacles or snake's body ends the game
- Score increases based on food type collected
- Speed effects are temporary and stack with base speed
- Base speed increases every 10 points
- High score system tracks best performance
- Game timer shows elapsed time
- Background music and sound effects enhance the experience
